# Bitcoin Price Forecasting Combining GRU and Different Exogenous Variables

Problem: 

Despite numerous studies aiming to improve the accuracy of Bitcoin price predictions, a significant portion of these efforts concentrate on comparing models using solely endogenous variables. Other research streams suggest that external factors may highly influence the price of Bitcoin. Therefore, the necessity to compare the impact of exogenous variables during the training process of a neural network becomes relevant and understudied.


Method: 

Our study will utilize empirical research through the use of experimentation. We will collect quantitative data employing a set of endogenous variables (Open, High, Low, Close, Market Cap, Volume), and another set of exogenous variables (Google Trends, GVZ, and FSI). Based on these variables, we will conduct simulations using the GRU, and analyze, through a quantitative analysis, which exogenous variable provides better accuracy.
